            <h1>Bob Ross is the man.</h1>
            <p>
                Let's have a little bit of fun today. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let
                them all be individuals. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Fluff it up
                a little and hypnotize it. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the
                sky. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you
                could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If what you're doing doesn't make you
                happy - you're doing the wrong thing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now it's beginning to make a little sense. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Just think
                about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. We'll take a little bit
                of Van Dyke Brown. What the devil. This is an example of what you can do with just a few
                things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. It's almost like something out
                of a fairytale book. Work on one thing at a time. You can create beautiful things - but you
                have to see them in your mind first. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Maybe
                there's a little something happening right here.
            </p>

            <p>
                In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get
                carried away - we have plenty of time. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.
                Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn
                to use them. Don't fiddle with it all day. All kinds of happy little splashes. We artists are
                a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.
            </p>

            <p>
                I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and
                little rabbits and stuff. In this world, everything can be happy. Steve wants reflections, so
                let's give him reflections. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.
                It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. And I will hypnotize
                that just a little bit. There it is. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to
                build the framework first.  The least little bit can do so much. We don't really know where
                this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.
