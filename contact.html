                Allons-y! Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim.
                But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been
                ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of
                man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. I don't want to go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. People assume that
                time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint,
                it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a
                kettle and some string! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would
                ever tell anyone my name. I don't want to go.

                Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Black tie...Whenever I wear this,
                something bad always happens. There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called
                the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family.
                My friends. Even that sky.

                Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. Iâ€™m absolutely sorted. Geronimo! Frightened people. Give me a Dalek
                any day. You are the only mystery worth solving. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! I never know
                why. I only know who. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll
                certainly be the first to know. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I
                don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little
                guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every
                black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. It's a fez. I wear
                a fez now. Fezzes are cool.
